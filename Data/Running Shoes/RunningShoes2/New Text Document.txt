HOW ARE THE RUN ACTIVE SHOES SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR RUNNING?	When you run, the shock wave generated by each impact with the ground corresponds to approximately three times your weight. This wave runs from the heel to the top of the spinal column. Your joints act as shock absorbers, but this puts a lot of pressure on them. We designed the KALENJI RUN ACTIVE running shoes to protect you from shocks and impact.
WHY IS THERE CUSHIONING IN RUNNING SHOES?	In order to keep on running, you need to protect your body (joints, back, knees etc.) effectively from shocks and vibrations. The cushioning in the RUN ACTIVE shoe is designed to limit the effect of repeated impact on occasional runners.
HOW DO WE GUARANTEE THE CUSHIONING OF THE RUN ACTIVE RUNNING SHOES?	The cushioning in the RUN ACTIVE shoes is made with EVA (Ethylene-Vinyl acetate) foam which is both lightweight and offers good shock absorption. Due to its position at the heel and its special shape, the CS (Circular System) technology optimises shock absorption.
HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT SIZE OF RUNNING SHOE	Choose one size bigger than your usual size to ensure optimum comfort in your RUN ACTIVE shoes. There should be 1 cm between your toe and the end of your shoe, as your feet swell during exercise.
WHICH SIZES ARE AVAILABLE?	From 3 to 8
HOW MUCH DOES A RUN ACTIVE SHOE WEIGH?	204 g in size 5.5
WHAT DOES THE DROP OF A SHOE MEAN?	'Drop' is the difference between the height of the back (heel) and front (forefoot) of the shoe.
WHAT IS THE DROP ON A RUN ACTIVE RUNNING SHOE?	The height difference between the back and front of the sole is 10mm.
HOW DO I CARE FOR MY RUN ACTIVE SHOES?	We recommend that you avoid machine washing your shoes as this causes damage to the technological and material properties of the shoe; they may come unstuck or shrink, and upper fabric may tear. When shoes are very dirty (mud), we recommend washing them with soapy water and a synthetic brush. Definitely don't use bleach! Rinse with fresh water. Avoid putting shoes near a heat source to dry.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF RUNNING?	Running will enable you to: 1.get some fresh air 2.look after your body 3.develop your muscles gradually 4.maintain or lose weight 5.improve the health of your bones
