WHY ARE RUN CUSHION SHOES DESIGNED FOR BEGINNER AND OCCASIONAL RUNNERS?	The simple, flexible and cushioning RUN CUSHION shoes provide all the benefits of a good running shoe. They also allow runners to run with a natural stride thanks to: - their flexibility, which doesn't hinder the foot's natural movements - their 6mm drop, which tells you how much taller the heel is than the forefoot The smaller the drop, the less runners are required to strike with their heel first, allowing them to use their natural stride.
WHY ARE RUN CUSHION SHOES COMFORTABLE?	Three elements contribute to the comfort of the RUN CUSHION running shoes, which have been especially designed for beginner or occasional runners: their cushioning foam, their user comfort and their low weight. EVA foam. It is soft and flexible for optimum cushioning. Their low weight means you will forget you are wearing them as you run.
WHY IS THERE CUSHIONING IN RUNNING SHOES?	The cushioning in the RUN CUSHION shoes has been designed to limit repeated impact for beginner and occasional runners, with a sole made from soft and flexible EVA foam.
