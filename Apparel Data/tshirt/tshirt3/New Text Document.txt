A T-SHIRT ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR FITNESS THAT CAN DO SO MUCH MORE!	A morning toning workout; a work meeting; an active walk between noon and 2; a quick stop at the shop to top up the fridge; time at home with the family or out with friends: Wouldn't it be nice if you could do it all in the same outfit? That's exactly what we designed this range to do: take you from home to work and everything in between, without having to change clothes for every activity.
DID YOU SAY COMFORT?	Imagine being both comfortable and stylish all day long as you go from work, home, the gym, and everything else. Sounds nice, doesn't it? We thought so too. As textile designers, we were in a good place to bring this crazy idea to life. And voilà - our range is here! This comfortable range doesn't compromise on style: it features products that are as nice to wear as they are to look at!
A GREAT T-SHIRT: YOUR GO-TO EVERY TIME!	You don't need to be a full-on fashionista to throw together an outfit that works. Our T-shirt has got you covered. How? The long sleeves are perfect for summer evenings, autumn days, and winter mornings when layered under a cosy cardigan. The crew neck is flattering while the straight cut is comfy. So will it get your thumbs up? (Go on, you know it's a YES).
FABRIC WEIGHT	This product's fabric weighs 180 g/m².
